General settings
================

Location
--------

General config items are placed as simple (scalar) properties under
the path '/general'. The keys match those from the classic xfwmrc file.
Xfconf data is read after xfwmrc and thus overriding it.

Keys
----

.. csv-table::
  :file: general-keys.csv
  :header-rows: 1

Example
-------

.. literalinclude:: general-example.xml
    :language: xml
