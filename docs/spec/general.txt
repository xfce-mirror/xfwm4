Xfconf is a hierarchical (tree-like) configuration system where the
immediate child nodes of the root are called "channels".  All settings
beneath the channel nodes are called "properties."

Valid channel and property names are composed of the ASCII US-English
uppercase characters A-Z, lowercase characters a-z, numerals 0-9, the
dash (-), and underscore (_).  No other characters are allowed for
channel names.  The less than (<) and greater than (>) characters
(aka "angle brackets") are also allowed in property names, but not
in channel names.

Property names are referenced by their "full path" underneath their
channel, for example: "/main/history-window/last-accessed".  Of course,
when querying a particular property, the channel must be specified
separately as well.

Both channel and property names are case-insensitive.  For example,
the following four all refer to the same property:

  Channel: ExampleApp, property: /main/history-window/last-accessed
  Channel: EXAMPLEAPP, property: /main/history-window/last-accessed
  Channel: ExampleApp, property: /Main/History-Window/Last-Accessed
  Channel: exampleapp, property: /MAIN/history-window/last-accessed
